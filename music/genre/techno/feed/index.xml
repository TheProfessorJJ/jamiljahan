										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Create unlimited album releases, easily add music via drag and drop from your computer and create the playlist in a second. For each track you can add a download link, label, release date, catalog number, artists, cover and more.</p>
<p>Every release album can also have its own video or image background, to promote the music in the best way ever.</p>
<p>Album releases are also correlated by their own taxonomy (music genre) to make it easy to list specific releases divided by groups. Below each release other album with similar categories will automatically be listed, for an optimal navigation.</p>
<p>Each album can have unlimited purchase links. For each track you can optionally add also a SoundCloud or Youtube URL.<br />
Each track can have unlimited artists, and they are automatically linked to the related artist page in your website (if existing).</p>
